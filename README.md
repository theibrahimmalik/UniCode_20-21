## :smile: :chart_with_upwards_trend: Learn and improve through competing
• Practice makes perfect, and Showcode challenges are the perfect opportunity to learn by doing. 

• If a certain challenge doesn’t go well, you can go back and practice afterwards.

## :moneybag: Build your coder-first profile to share
• You can build up a profile of achievements, badges and certificates. 

• Share your profile and show companies your potential based on coding ability, rather than qualifications or experience

## :clipboard:  How it works?
• 84 University Teams 
• Spread over 6 leagues 
• Battle head-to-head for points 
• Win awesome prizes 
• Get noticed by top brands

## :red_car:  How Long is it?
• There is a total of 13 challenges to complete,  each one taking no more than an hour to complete. 

• A challenge is open for 2 weeks and only your first submission will count for scoring.

## :rocket:  How you win?
• Each coder can contribute points towards their University by completing a challenge. 

• The team with the highest points  (taken from the top 10 individual scores) will win the fixture and obtain 3 points.

## :trophy: The Grande Finale
• The top 10 coders from each of the 5 Universities in each league will battle it out in the Unicode 20/21 Grand Finale to claim top spot. 

• Don’t worry, you can still qualify for the individual finale if your team doesn’t make it
